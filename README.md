# UE MOBAPP Coursework Repository 📘💻

Welcome to my repository for the **UE MOBAPP** course at IMT Atlantique, where I'm diving deep into the worlds of Android programming, with Java using Gradle. This space serves as a digital notebook and showcase of what I've learned and created along the way.

## About UE MOBAPP 🎓

UE MOBAPP (MOBile APPlication) is a course designed to give students a solid foundation in developing Andoird Application, in Java.
Throughout this course, I've tackled:

- The fundamentals of the Android platform and its development capabilities.
- The Android component model, crucial for all applications.
- Developing graphical user interfaces to make apps intuitive and engaging.
- Utilizing Android device features like geolocation and multimedia capture.

## Projects and Exercises 🚀

- **MyFirstApplication**: The end project, using all the different notions we discovered through this UE.
- **MyBasicCounterApplication**: A basic exercise to manipulate Shared Preferences.
- **MyIntentApplication**: A basic exercise to manipulate intents and launching activities.
- **MyFragmentApplication**: An exercise to manipulate fragments.

## Tools & Technologies 🛠️

This course has me working with:

- **OS**: MacOS
- **Shell**: Fish
- **Terminal**: kitty
- **Terminal multiplexer**: tmux
- **IDE**: Nvim
- **Android Studio**: The heart of Android development, providing the IDE and tools needed to build apps.
- **Java**: The primary language for Android app development, offering a robust tool kit for object-oriented programming.
- **Git**: For version control, ensuring that every step of my development process is tracked and managed.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Here's what I'm set to achieve:

- **Hands-on Development**: Building applications that respond to the unique demands of mobile computing.
- **Data Management**: Implementing persistent data storage to keep the user's data safe.
- **Sensor Utilization**: Bringing applications to life by integrating the device's hardware capabilities.
- **Mapping and Location Services**: Enhancing user experience with geolocation and custom maps. (I actually chose the Data Management, and didn't got to discover maps unfortunately)

## Prerequisites ✅

- A strong foundation in Java programming, particularly in object-oriented concepts.
